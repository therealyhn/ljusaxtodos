          Ljusa & Todos first crossed paths in Stockholm's underground music scene in 2019. 
          What started as a chance meeting at a local warehouse party evolved into a creative 
          partnership that has redefined collaborative DJing.

          Our back-to-back sets are more than just two DJs playing togetherâ€”they're conversations 
          in sound, where melodic progressions meet industrial beats, creating something entirely new. 
          Each performance is an exploration of contrast and harmony, darkness and light.
        </p>

          Whether performing solo or together, we're committed to pushing boundaries and creating 
          experiences that resonate long after the music stops. Our mission is to elevate every event, 
          bringing both technical excellence and creative innovation to the dance floor.
